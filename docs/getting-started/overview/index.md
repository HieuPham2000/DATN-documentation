# Overview

This section introduces **the core concepts and features** that HUST PVO provides.

## Core concepts

There are 3 core concepts of HUST PVO: **Concept**, **Example** and **Dictionary**.

1. **Concept** here is a word, a phrase or a group of words, used to represent a certain meaning. For example, a single word like *free*, *freedom*, *hero*,... a phrase like *look after*,... a group of words like *reason-cause*,...

2. **Example** here is a phrase, a sentence or a paragraph describing how to use vocabulary with a specific meaning. **Example** will have corresponding ***tone***, ***mode***, ***register***, ***nuance*** and ***dialect*** properties to determine the context to use. For example, *shake a leg* is an **example** where the tone is *informal*, nuance is *old-fashioned*, and the mode is *spoken*.

3. **Dictionary** is where **concepts** and **examples** are stored. One user account can create multiple dictionaries for different purposes. For example, user A creates 1 dictionary to store communication vocabulary and another dictionary for IELTS exam preparation.

HUST PVO is a link-based learning system that helps learners learn vocabulary by association mechanism. Therefore, HUST PVO allows users to create two types of semantic association:

1. Link between concept (*Association*, *Type of*. Default is *No link*).

2. Link between example and concept (*Idiom*, *Nominal*, *Agent*, *Patient*, *Action*, *Described by*, *Describing*, *Other phrase*. Default is *No link*).

Creating appropriate associations helps to increase vocabulary recall, increase efficiency in learning and using vocabulary.
